# GAN-From-Scratch
A Generative Adversarial Network made only using NumPy and Python. \
The Generator and Discriminator sample graphical data, which the Discriminator learns to
tell between bogus and real data, and the Generator learns to fool the Discriminator 
by generating real-looking graphical data. \

Enjoy!
